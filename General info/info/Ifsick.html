        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png" alt=""> If you have a fever, cough or other symptoms, you might have COVID-19. Most people have mild illness and are able to recover at home. If you are sick:
          Keep track of your symptoms.
          If you have an emergency warning sign (including trouble breathing), call 911.
        </h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> Stay home. Most people with COVID-19 have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. Do not leave your home, except to get medical care. Do not visit public areas.</h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> Take care of yourself. Get rest and stay hydrated. Take over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen, to help you feel better.</h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> Stay in touch with your doctor. Call before you get medical care. Be sure to get care if you have trouble breathing, or have any other emergency warning signs, or if you think it is an emergency.</h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> Avoid public transportation, ride-sharing, or taxis.</h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> As much as possible, stay in a specific room and away from other people and pets in your home. If possible, you should use a separate bathroom. If you need to be around other people or animals in or outside of the home, wear a mask..</h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> Tell your close contacts that they may have been exposed to COVID-19. An infected person can spread COVID-19 starting 48 hours (or 2 days) before the person has any symptoms or tests positive. By letting your close contacts know they may have been exposed to COVID-19, you are helping to protect everyone.</h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> You can visit your state, tribal, localexternal icon, and territorial health departmentâ€™s website to look for the latest local information on testing sites.</h4><br>

        <h4><img src="check-circle-07.png"> Follow care instructions from your healthcare provider and local health department. Your local health authorities may give instructions on checking your symptoms and reporting information.</h4><br>
